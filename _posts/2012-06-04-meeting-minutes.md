Some events that we came up with during this EC Meeting:
-Computer Building Workshop 
-Root your phone day
-Android dev talk

Also we had some ideas atracting more new students for the ACM. Lasts's year talk from Ryan, Nathan 
and Austen seem to ve very well recieved by the kids of a local high school, so this is an event that we will try to repeate this year. Another idea was to atract some freshman and sophomore is to organize programing competition for first year students. With this we will let them compete with people from their own level and we will not scare them by comepting against people of later years.

We should not forget to stablish a day during the summer for cutting some ethernet cable too.
