We had a great rush planned this year, and a lot of peopled showed up, but that's only the beginning!

Come join us this friday as we discuss our trip to UIUC, vote on extended positions, and try and organise Special Interest Groups.

Later this month we have planned  a trip to Microsoft, and polaris want's us involved in their tech expo.

Thanks
