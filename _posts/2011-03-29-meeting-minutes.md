<strong>Philanthropy Project:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>We will not be doing the farming simulator thing until next year's project.</li>
	<li>We decided this because there is not enough time to talk to the companies to get it out there.</li>

	<li>The food drive will take place from Monday, April 11th through the 15th.</li>
	<li>We will have a full member game-night meeting following the food drive on Friday, April 15th.
<ul>
	<li>There will be pizza at this meeting and members are to either bring non-perishable food items or $2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<strong>Nomination Night:</strong></ul>
