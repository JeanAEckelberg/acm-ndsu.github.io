As you know, the ACM office has a pretty sweet arcade cabinet. It uses a salvaged housing, new joysticks/buttons, and one of our computers running a MAME emulator. What you may not know is that SIG-GDev is in the process of restoring it to be something we can put in a public area of campus. We have a new controller board, we've ordered a coin acceptor, and we're meeting next week to do some carpentry. Some of our members have begun developing our own games to play on it. One thing we don't have yet, however, is sweet artwork to decorate the sides and front of the cabinet.

Luckily, ACM is full of very talented members who would love to showcase their skills to the rest of the chapter and to the entire student body of NDSU~

So, we're having a contest! The basic idea is to<strong> design the sides and front of the arcade cabinet</strong>. The winning submission will be used as we finish the restoration. Submissions are due <strong>Monday, March 28</strong>. You must be a member to participate.

Interested? Here are the details.
<ul>
	<li>The traditional method to decorate the cabinet is with really big stickers, which would be affixed to the appropriate parts of the housing. If you have a different idea, however, feel free to submit it!</li>
	<li>Please email submissions to <a href="mailto:abram.jackson.1@my.ndsu.edu">abram.jackson.1@my.ndsu.edu</a> with "Arcade Cabinet Design" in the subject line. Full resolution images at tens of megabytes aren't necessary, but send enough so we can envision what it will look like.</li>
	<li>The dimensions of the cabinet can be found here: <a href="http://www.jakobud.com/plan.php?id=21">http://www.jakobud.com/plan.php?id=21</a> You should include a design for the entire side (both) of the cabinet, as well as the two areas on the front as shown below. More than that is definitely welcome, but not required.</li>
	<li>It's not necessary to use the exact dimensions of the cabinet in your submissions, as long as you're willing to help us make corrections if it wins. However, if you want you can stop by the office to look at it for inspiration/measurements.</li>
	<li>The winning design will be selected on Tuesday, March 29 by non-participating SIG-GDev members if any, or by the ACM Executive Council. We'll then contact you to obtain the appropriate resolution/format, and we'll get it printed/created and attached to the cabinet.</li>
	<li>If you want to use any NDSU logos, please follow these guidelines: <a href="http://www.ndsu.edu/vpur/resources/logousage/">http://www.ndsu.edu/vpur/resources/logousage/</a></li>
