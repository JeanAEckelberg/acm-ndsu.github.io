As an overview of what we will be doing:
<ul>
	<li>Our plan is to set up a booth in the IACC, provided we are allowed, where we will take shifts playing the games.</li>
	<li>Naturally, the game will be very boring or very bad, we must choose which ones we will choose.</li>
	<li>We are doing this to raise awareness of the charity "Child's Play" and to try to get donations for it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What will the format and structure of this thing be?
<ul>
	<li>We will play some game for an extended period of time.</li>
	<li>It will take place sometime after spring break, maybe in early April.</li>
	<li>For corporate sponsors, Austen and Nathan will be in charge of contacting corporate sponsors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>We should probably make sure that we aren't extremely loud in the IACC because regular classes will be going on during this time.</li>
	<li>Game Possibilities???
<ul>
	<li>Desert Bus</li>
	<li>Tetris</li>
	<li>Dragon Warrior</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>We should probably have n+1 people at any given time at the booth, where n is the number of people playing a game.</li>
	<li>Austen will talk to ITS next week about taking up space for this in the IACC.</li>
	<li>We will have a leader board displayed that will keep track of the hourly totals put in from each ACM member.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Decisions:</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Game: </strong>Farming Simulator 2011</li>
	<li><strong>Duration: </strong>Start on a Monday in early April, and go until at most Sunday.</li>
	<li>Adam will buy the game this weekend and find out the mechanics of the game.</li>
	<li>Decorations such as the member being dressed up and sit in an old bucket seat type chair.</li>
</ul>
We will plan to meet next week, Tuesday at 7pm to discuss a little more about the details.
