Things Talked About:
---------------------
- MICS Reimbursement
  - Jordan was has not yet picked up the MICS check from Student Activities as he was sick
- RetroJam
    - Phase 1 Goals Due today
    - Phase 2 Goals Due August 20th
    - Jordan will write up phase 2 goals by next meeting.
    - Reminder that the event will be canceled if any phase 2 goals are not complete by phase 2.
    - Because phase 2 and onward will have longer due dates, if any goals are not met by their assigned due dates the event is canceled.
      - This is to make sure that the goals are not left until the last minute and snowball as is happening with phase 1.
- Meeting attendance
  - Meeting attendance is required except in the case of extenuating circumstances.
  - It is unacceptable that those who are on time have continually had to wait (upwards of 40-60min) for other members of the EC to arrive late.
  - Meetings start at 8:00pm if less than two people do not show up without having emailed and made it known to everyone that they will miss (at least 3 hours prior to the meeting time), the meeting will be canceled.
  - Members who miss meetings for any reason are responsible for reading the weekly meeting minutes and bringing any questions to the next EC meeting.
