- Byte-le Royale Postmortem
    - Similar level of issues to Market Space
        - Not the worst, but close. Lots of room for improvement.
    - Issues
        - Wren left early, only one with strong idea of final game design
            - In future design should be discussed in depth at start of development
            - All devs should understand plan and goals for game
        - Scrimmage Server
            - Major problems, needs rework or rewrite
        - Lack of accountability
            - Need more active role/better mentoring
            - Hierarchy brought up
                - Could result in conflict of egos
            - Potential for Scrum Master/Project Manager role
                - Create project guidelines, scrum master responsible for ensuring process is followed
                - May not solve development issues
        - Development Timeline
            - Critical components of game need to be finished sooner
            - Development should continue over the summer
            - Ideally allow several months for testing and balancing
        - Pull Requests
            - Need to be stricter
            - Weekly PR
                - Review, identify issues
                - Game must run, no partial implementations merged
                - Unit Tests put in place when introducing new feature
                    - Test abnormal input
            - More people need to review
                - Tag at least two people to review
        - Visualizer 
            - Needs to be started earlier
