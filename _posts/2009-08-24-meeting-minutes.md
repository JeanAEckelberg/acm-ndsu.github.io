Hello everybody, welcome back to NDSU. We've got a lot lined up for this fall semester, so pay attention to the emails we send out.

This year, we want you to pick a special interest group and be active in it. For the artistic, we have SIG-Art. If you like software development, we have SIG-Gdev. If you are a woman interested in mathematics and science, SIG-Chix is for you. If you are a nerd desiring to be in shape, then check out SIG-fit.

If you are really pro, then get involved in SIG-comp to win glory in programming competittions.

Any questions? Email the Chair: Joel.Longanecker@ndsu.edu

Thanks!
