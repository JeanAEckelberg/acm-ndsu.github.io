Oh man all kinds of stuff has been happening. If you haven't noticed, we've:
<ul>
	<li>Gained so many members</li>
	<li>Added like five more websites</li>
	<li>Corporate meetings, sig meetings (art, chix, comp, gdev)</li>
	<li>Held a game AI competition</li>
	<li>A bunch of regular member meetings</li>
</ul>
This stuff is bananas!

On top of all that, we're still doing stuff! We've got a sig-gdev meeting monday, we've got a social on thursday or so - heck, we may even throw in another meeting next week, just for kicks! I can't even handle it.

And that's just the start. We're going to competitions in Thief River Falls, MN and Urbana-Champaign, IL in October, we're developing a game, we very well could be adding a new projector to the office... golly, we might even upgrade to a shiner new office later!

If this isn't the coolest club on campus, I don't even know what is!
