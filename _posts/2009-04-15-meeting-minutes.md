<span style="font-size: x-small;">Hi Dr. Slator,
 
My name is Claudia Murray and I work for Feed Management Systems. We are located in the Incubator building on the NDSU campus in the Research Park. We are looking for a student who would be interesting in a part-time job doing Software Quality Assurance. I thought perhaps you might have a few students in mind that we could interview.
 
I have attached the job description. Anyone that is interested can send their resume to either <a href="mailto:hr@feedsys.com">hr@feedsys.com</a> or me. Additional information about our company can be found at <a href="http://www.feedsys.com/">www.feedsys.com</a>. Please let me know if you have any questions for me. Thanks.
