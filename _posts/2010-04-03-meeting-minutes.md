Our ACM Chapter has prepared an AI-Game Competition, and we are extending you an invitation to compete in this Tri-College Competition!

Come compete with your fellow students for Honor! for Glory! and More!
(Hint: Prizes?)

WHAT: AI Game Competition!
WHEN: April 9th, 6pm - Midnight!
WHERE: NDSU IACC Building, Lab Room 244! Directions and Info by request!
HOW: Contact ME @ *nicholas.laney@ndsu.edu* If you plan on attending!

Details: The Rules of the game will not be released until the competition!
No prior strategizing! The code for the server and client is written, all you need to do is write your AI into the client and it goes! The only thing you need to know is you will be reading information about the game from a game state recieved from the server. This interaction between client and server is provided and easily used. Again, more details at the competition.

The programming languages you have to choose from is Java or Python. Each individual participant will have 5 to 6 hours to work on their code. You need not be an "advanced" coder to participate, nor should you need to understand the ins and outs of AI theory (but it certainly helps).

You need not be an ACM member to participate: the competition is open to all.

There is NO entry fee! Thats right, you heard me; FREE!!1! Although, you may wish to bring cash; if enough people are interested, we might order pizza.

If you have any questions or wish to participate, email me @
*nicholas.laney@ndsu.edu*

You MUST email me! I need a head count by April 7th for the competition!

In case you cant tell, I'm excited for this competition! YOU SHOULD BE TOO!!!
