We are looking for an intern with the following:
-          Coding experience/classes in .NET
-          Experience with testing (not necessary, but desired)
 
This intern be responsible for the system integration testing 
Selenium primarily. With coding experience, we can then have the intern do some misc. coding on the project when time is available.
 
Thanks again,
Bob
