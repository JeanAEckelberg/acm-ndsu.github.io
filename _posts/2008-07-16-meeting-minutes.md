hey all, just for the fun of it, lets have a virtual lan party!

<em>What? How does this work?</em>

It's simple!

1. Go to https://secure.logmein.com/products/hamachi/list.asp and download the Windows client!
2. select the basic version install
3. create a nick name
4. Join the network NDSU-ACM. The password is the same as in the office for the common machines.

Yay, you are on the VPN!

Now, get some games... Right now we are shooting for open sourced games, or other free games. (They don't all suck!)

1. Urban Terror! http://www.urbanterror.net/news.php Get it! This is probably going to be the most played one.
2. Alien Arena http://red.planetarena.com/ A fast, fun, free multiplayer FPS based on the quake II Engine.
3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AssaultCube (It's kinda like conuterstrike!)

Let's Kick it off at <strong>8:00 PM Thursday, July 17th!</strong>

Oh yeah, if you use Linux or OSX, you can play too, but you are on your own for setting things up
