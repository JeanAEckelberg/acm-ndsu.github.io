We are having our annual Spring Picnic this Saturday, May 9! Enjoy the weekend and spend some time outside.

Come to the Yunker Farm Gazebo from 3pm-9pm. We're providing plates, napkins, drinks, condiments, etc. you just need to bring something to grill. It's going to be awesome! No doubt we'll be talking about it all year, so don't miss it!
